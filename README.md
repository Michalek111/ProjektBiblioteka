# ProjektBiblioteka

- Author deleted option to raise issues, also in the past he have been removing them.
- In the past impostor named @bumipl tried to implement malicious code into repository. Fortunetely @Michalek111 corrected code (after he implemented scammer's code) fast enough there were no victims.
Overall, taking above into account please do not use this project.
